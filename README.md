# Statcast Regression

Statcast is Major League Baseball's video tracking system that logs data
 for each pitch and play in every MLB baseball game. A recent spike in 
leaguewide homerun totals have been ascribed to adjustments hitters have made 
based on Statcast data. Namely, players are increasing their batted ball 
launch angle which is leading to better outcomes (Specifically, more homeruns)
